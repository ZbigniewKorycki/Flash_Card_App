<h1>Flash Card App</h1>

The Flash Card App is a Python application built using the Tkinter library. It allows users to learn and practice vocabulary words in a flashcard format. The app displays a word in one language and prompts the user to guess its translation. Users can mark whether they know the translation or not.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 31.
